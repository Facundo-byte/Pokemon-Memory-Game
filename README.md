# üéÆ Pokemon Memory Game

A memory game built with **React** using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch and display Pok√©mon.

## üìù Description

The goal of the game is simple:

* Click on a Pok√©mon to score points.
* Each time you select one, the board reshuffles with new Pok√©mon.
* Be careful! If you click the same Pok√©mon more than once, you lose and your score resets to zero.
* The game keeps track of both your **current score** and your **highest record**, so you can challenge yourself to beat it.

## üöÄ Technologies

* React (with Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`)
* CSS for styling
* Fetch API to retrieve data from PokeAPI
